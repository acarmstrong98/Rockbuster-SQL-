Here is a SQL query that pulls the top 5 customers from the top 10 cities in the top 10 countries and sorts the countries in order of most top 5 customers

WITH customer_summary (customer_id, first_name, last_name, city, country, total_amount_paid) AS
  (SELECT A.customer_id,
    A.first_name,
    A.last_name,
    C.city,
    D.country,

    INNER JOIN address B
      ON A.address_id = B.address_id

      ON B.city_id = C.city_id
    INNER JOIN country D
      ON C.country_id = D.country_id
    INNER JOIN payment F
      ON A.customer_id = F.customer_id
  GROUP BY C.city, D.country, A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name
  ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
  ),
